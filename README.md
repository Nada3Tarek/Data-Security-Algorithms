## 🧠 Project Description

This project implements a variety of classical, symmetric, and asymmetric encryption algorithms as part of a Data Security course.

The goal is to demonstrate how different encryption techniques work, their strengths, weaknesses, and computational differences.

## 🔐 Algorithms Implemented

### ✅ Symmetric Encryption:
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- 3DES (Triple DES)
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Autokey Cipher
- Repeating Key Cipher (Vigenère)
- Hill Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Monoalphabetic Cipher
- Columnar Transposition Cipher
- Caesar Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher

### ✅ Asymmetric Encryption:
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- ElGamal
- Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange

### ✅ Others:
- Extended Euclidean Algorithm (used in modular inverses & RSA key generation)
